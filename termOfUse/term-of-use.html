                will automatically charge your selected Payment Method for the
                Subscription Fee payable by you through a third-party payment
                gateway at the beginning of your Subscription or at the end of
                any free trial period (unless you cancel your subscription prior
                to the end of the free trial period or the Subscription period),
                and automatically on each subsequent renewal of your
                Subscription unless and until you cancel your Subscription, or

                discontinued by Disney in accordance with these Terms of Use.
                Whenever you add a new credit card to your account, a small
                authorisation charge may be deducted as a one-time charge to
                verify that your account is active. The amount will be refunded
                to you automatically. Your bank will process your refund within
                30 (thirty) days or such period as determined by your bank. You
                may be charged certain fees or charges including foreign
                transaction fees relating to the processing of your payment by
                the Payment Method service provider. Please do check with your

                NOT be automatically renewed upon expiry of the Subscription
                period, based on the Payment Method being used by you for the
                Subscription. Unless your Payment Method is charged
                automatically at the time of renewal, you will be required to
                make a payment for the Subscription Fees to continue your
                Subscription. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you
                also agree that we may charge your Payment Method on file if you

                On cancellation of a Subscription, you will be notified by
                Disney (for further details on cancellations, please see below
                under ‘Cancellation &amp; Refund’). To see the commencement date
                of your next renewal period and information on your billing

                Once you have made a payment, it may take a few days for your
                payment made to Disney to be reflected in your "My Account"
                section.

                Changing Payment Method. You will be able to change your Payment
                Method only when your Subscription expires and you renew

                Change in Subscription Plan. Disney will be automatically
                billing as per your Payment Method for each Subscription period
                as per the Subscription plan subscribed by you. However, if you
                change your subscription plan, this could result in changing the
                day on which you are billed and the amount which you are billed
                for. In certain circumstances, Disney may at its sole
                discretion, allow you to subscribe to a new Subscription plan
                with a longer period, and in doing so allow you to change your
                existing Subscription plan to another (with a longer
                Subscription period), you would be required to pay the
                difference in rates (on a pro rata basis) for the new
                Subscription plan selected and would be billed as per the new
                Subscription plan from the next billing / renewal cycle. Disney
                will notify you in advance of the change in the Subscription Fee
                payable. The new Subscription will be effective from the date on
                which you select such plan and make appropriate payments as
                necessary. If you subscribed via a third party, any change in
                Subscription plans shall be through such third party(ies). It is
                hereby clarified that Disney shall NOT be liable for any refunds
                in case the Subscription Fees of your new Subscription plan is
                less than your existing Subscription plan.
